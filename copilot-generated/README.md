## 🔍 Review Process

All AI-generated content should be reviewed before being moved to the main project structure:

1. **Quality Check**: Verify the code quality and adherence to project standards
2. **Functionality Test**: Ensure the generated code works as expected
3. **Integration Review**: Check compatibility with existing codebase
4. **Documentation**: Ensure proper documentation and comments
5. **Move to Production**: Transfer approved code to appropriate directories

## 📝 Usage Guidelines

- Always review and test generated code before production use
- Update the review log with details about generated content
- Consider generated code as starting points that may need refinement

## 🚀 Best Practices
